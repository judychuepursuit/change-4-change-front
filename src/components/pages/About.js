    In 2022, the average age of a donator in the US was 65 years old. Since 2016, the average donor age has increased from 62 to 65. This is an indication that nonprofits have not yet fully tapped into the charitable behavior of younger generations. Across all the categories of fundraising statistics that we've examined, it's clear that nonprofits of all sizes routinely leave a lot of potential revenue on the table. As philanthropic giving continues to grow, organizations should prepare to pursue new opportunities as they emerge. It can be beneficial to take into account demographic changes, growth in corporate giving trends, and the dominance of mobile web browsing when developing updated fundraising strategies in the coming years.
